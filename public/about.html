<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Samuel Adewumi — a passionate Full Stack Developer based in Lagos, Nigeria, with a love for turning bold ideas into beautiful, functional digital experiences. Whether I’m coding an elegant backend API or designing a user-centric interface, I’m at home building complete, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems. I live in Lagos, Nigeria — a city that pulses with creativity, hustle, and tech innovation. The energy here is contagious and has shaped my drive as a developer and creative thinker. Whether I’m collaborating remotely or working on a local project, I bring the same energy and professionalism that the city inspires in me every day.
But I’m not just defined by the code I write — I’m a multi-dimensional individual with diverse interests, a curious mind, and a balanced personality. This page is a little glimpse into who I am — both as a professional and as a person.</p>

<p>My journey into tech started with curiosity — that natural itch to know how things work. From tinkering with HTML/CSS in the early days to mastering frameworks and full-stack architecture, I’ve grown into a developer who thrives on solving complex problems and building meaningful products.

  I work comfortably across both frontend and backend technologies, building everything from responsive user interfaces to robust RESTful APIs and database architectures. My tech stack includes (but is not limited to):
  
  <ol type="i">
    <li >Frontend: React, Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript</li>
  
    <li>Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Django, PHP, Laravel</li>
    
    <li>Dev Tools: Git, Docker, CI/CD, Webpack, Postman</li>
    
    <li>Other Skills: API integration, authentication systems, payment gateways, cloud deployment, testing, version control</li>
  </ol>
  
I believe in clean, maintainable code, agile collaboration, and continuous learning. I take pride in building products that don’t just work — they scale, they delight, and they last.
</p>

<p>When I’m not deep in development mode, I’m fully immersed in some of my greatest passions — football, basketball, and video games.

  I’m a die-hard football fan (ask me about Premier League stats or the latest Champions League twist and I’ll have thoughts!).
  
  I love basketball for its rhythm, strategy, and intensity — I often draw parallels between a well-executed play and a well-structured app.
  
  Gaming helps me unwind and inspires my creativity — the level design, UX decisions, and immersive storytelling fascinate me as a developer and as a player.
  
  These passions don’t just entertain me — they influence how I think, collaborate, and solve problems. Just like in sports, I value teamwork, strategy, and the thrill of a good challenge.

  I consider myself an ambivert, blending the best of both worlds. I’m equally comfortable:

  Collaborating with a team in a dynamic environment
  
  Or focusing quietly on a solo project for hours
  
  This balance helps me adapt to different work cultures, clients, and project needs. I love learning from others, exchanging ideas, and growing through meaningful conversations — but I also value deep focus and self-reflection.</p>
